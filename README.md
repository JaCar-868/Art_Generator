# Art_Generator
## Overview

Welcome to the "Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer" project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Neural Style Transfer, an algorithm introduced by Gatys et al. (2015). The goal of this project is to merge the artistic style of one image with the content of another, creating a visually appealing result.

## Introduction

Neural Style Transfer is a fascinating application of deep learning where the style of a reference image is applied to a target image, resulting in a combined output that maintains the content of the target image but appears to be painted in the style of the reference image. This technique has applications in digital art, image processing, and creative AI.

In this notebook, you will:
- Demonstrate the basics of Neural Style Transfer.
- Implement the algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Experiment with different images to create stunning artworks.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer.git
cd neural-style-transfer

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells and observe the results. You can experiment with different content and style images to create your unique artworks.

## Examples
Here is an example of the results you can achieve with Neural Style Transfer:
